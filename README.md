This website serves as the digital hub for the IEEE ENSI Student Branch, providing information, updates, and resources for our members and visitors. Developed with modern web technologies, it offers an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Technology Stack

The website is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **UI Framework:** TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Dynamic Content:** Members can stay updated with the latest news, events, and announcements.
- **Event Calendar:** An interactive calendar displaying upcoming events and deadlines.
- **Member Directory:** Allows visitors to learn more about our team members and their roles.
- **Contact Form:** Enables easy communication with the IEEE ENSI SB team.

## Development Process

The development of the IEEE ENSI SB website followed a collaborative approach, leveraging the strengths of ReactJS and TailwindCSS:

- **ReactJS:** Used to create a highly interactive and dynamic frontend. Components were modularized to promote reusability and maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS:** Applied for styling to quickly prototype and design the UI. Its utility-first approach facilitated rapid iteration and ensured a consistent design system.

## Getting Started

To explore the codebase or contribute to the project, clone the repository and follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   > git clone https://github.com/GuesmiGhassen/IEEE-ENSI-Student-Branch-Website.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your current working directory to the cloned repository:
   > cd ieee-ensi-sb-website
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   The project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. Install all required packages by running:
   > npm install

4. **Running the Website Locally:**
  After setting up the environment, you can run the website locally to see it in action. Execute the following command in the project directory:
  > npm run start

   This command starts a local development server. By default, the website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the website.

4. **Building for Production:**
  When you're ready to prepare the website for production, use the following command:
   > npm run build
   
   This command creates a `build` directory with a production-ready version of your website. You can deploy this directory to your hosting provider.
